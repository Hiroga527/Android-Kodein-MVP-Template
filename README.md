# Android-Kotlin-MVVM-Template

Short Intro:
Hi so this is the first thing I ever made here in Github. Cut me some slack if I miss anything, but do correct me harshly if I do something stupid. Growth can only come from hardships after all.

Anyways so this is my MVVM template. I use these stuff:
* Kotlin (Because Kotlin is life)
* [Kodein](https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kodein) (For dependency injection, I prefer it to Dagger)
* Examples of Kodein Usages
* [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) (Http Client)
* Android Architecture LiveData
* Android Architecture Lifecycle
* Android Architecture Room
* [Klaxon](https://github.com/cbeust/klaxon) (JSON Parser)
* [Logger](https://github.com/orhanobut/logger) (Logger)

This is currently my 2nd update with an even more improved template. Removed a lot of unnecessary junk code. Also modularized the project by separating Api from App.

I'll be adding some documentation in my 3rd update.

For every developer out there, please do tell me if there are ways to optimize my code. Thank you :)
