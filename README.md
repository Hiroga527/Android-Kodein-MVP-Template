# Android-Kotlin-MVVM-Template

Short Intro:
Hi so this is the first thing I ever made here in Github. Cut me some slack if I miss anything, but do correct me harshly if I do something stupid. Growth can only come from hardships after all.

Anyways so this is my MVVM template. I use these stuff:
* Kotlin (Because Kotlin is life)
* [Kodein](https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kodein) (For dependency injection, I prefer it to Dagger)
* [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) (Http Client)
* Android Architecture LiveData
* Android Architecture Lifecycle
* [Klaxon](https://github.com/cbeust/klaxon) (JSON Parser)
* [Logger](https://github.com/orhanobut/logger) (Logger)

This is just a small basic template. I'll edit and add more stuff to it soon. Hopefully you guys like it.

Stuff I want to add and show:
* Android Architecture Room
* More in depth usage of Kodein

For every developer out there, please do tell me if there are ways to optimize my code. Thank you :)
