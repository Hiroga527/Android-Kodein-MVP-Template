# Android-Kotlin-MVVM-Template

Short Intro:
Hi so this is the first thing I ever made here in Github. Cut me some slack if I miss anything, but do correct me harshly if I do something stupid. Growth can only come from hardships after all.

Anyways so this is my MVVM template. I use these stuff:
* Kotlin (Because Kotlin is life)
* [Kodein](https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kodein) (For dependency injection, I prefer it to Dagger)
* Examples of Kodein Usages
* [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) (Http Client)
* Android Architecture LiveData
* Android Architecture Lifecycle
* Android Architecture Room
* Android Architecture Paging
* [Klaxon](https://github.com/cbeust/klaxon) (JSON Parser)
* [Logger](https://github.com/orhanobut/logger) (Logger)

This is currently my 3rd update with an even more improved template.
* Renamed some directories and classes to fit with common name standards. E.g. Data -> Model
* Removed DataBinding and LastAdapter with current template, found LastAdapter incompatible with Android Architecture Paging Library.
* Added PagedListAdapter that comes with the Paging Library.

I'll be adding some documentation in my 4th update. 

For every developer out there, please do tell me if there are ways to optimize my code. Thank you :)
