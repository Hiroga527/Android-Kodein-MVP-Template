# Android-Kotlin-MVVM-Template

Short Intro:

Anyways so this is my MVVM template. I use these stuff:
* Kotlin (Because Kotlin is life)
* [Kodein-DI](https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI) (For dependency injection)
* Examples of Kodein Usages
* [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) (Http Client)
* Android Architecture LiveData
* Android Architecture Lifecycle
* Android Architecture Room
* Android Architecture Paging
* [Klaxon](https://github.com/cbeust/klaxon) (JSON Parser)
* [Logger](https://github.com/orhanobut/logger) (Logger)

Future Updates:
A much more in depth example of this template. For now a more simple example which you can expand easily.
